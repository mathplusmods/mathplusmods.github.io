              <p>
Dear colleagues,<br>
<br>
With this newsletter, I would like to inform you about the following topics:<br>
1.) First events of our activity group<br>
2.) Retreat 2019<br>
3.) Organizational issues<br>
4.) Associated members<br>
5.) Our webpage<br>
6.) New GAMM Activity Group on "Computational and Mathematical Methods
in Data Science"<br>
7.) SIAM Conference on Mathematics of Data Science 2020<br>
<br>

1.) First frequent events of our activity group<br>
===============================================<br>
We aim to start the following frequent events in the Fall Term of 2019 / 20:<br>
* Hot Topic-Talks<br>
* MATH+ Distinguished Lecture in Mathematics of Data Science<br>
<br>
Each event of the Hot Topic-Talks is devoted to an emerging novel
research direction in mathematics of data science and could even
be of a more visionary type. The key idea is to have lectures followed
by an intense discussion session with top international researchers to
learn from those and have also the chance to enjoy long debates
on those ideas. Such an event cannot host a too large number of
people, wherefore we restrict those events to MATH+ members.<br>
<br>
Some of the guests for a Hot Topic-Talk will be in addition invited for a
MATH+ Distinguished Lecture in Mathematics of Data Science, which
 is then open to a large audience also beyond MATH+.<br>
<br>
We are currently applying for funding for both event series, and will
let you know after the decision of the MATH+ board. There will then
also be a call for suggestions for topics and speakers.<br>
<br>
2.) Retreat 2019<br>
================<br>
As discussed in our inaugural meeting, it is essential to have one
event in our list of events which provides a means for the faculty to
interact scientifically, discuss novel research topics, and initiate
collaborations in a secluded environment without disturbances.
Having a retreat in the vicinity of Berlin, but not at one of the
universities, would indeed allow intense discussions without
interruptions within a small group of colleagues. We aim to dedicate
the first of such retreats to the area of "Machine Learning Methods
in Applied Mathematics".<br>
<br>
We are now applying for funding, and will let you know after the
decision of the MATH+ board. Then the dates will be announced, and
there will also be a call for ideas for this retreat.<br>
<br>
3.) Organizational issues<br>
=========================<br>
The organizational side of our activity group is still being
discussed. In my function as MATH+ special coordinator for
mathematical data science, I am currently applying to the MATH+
board for support for all organizational aspects of this activity
group, for building up a teaching programm in this area, and for
other activities in mathematical data science. I will also here let
you know once a decision is reached.<br>
<br>
4.) Associated members<br>
======================<br>
We aim to  invite scientists who are not a member of MATH+ to
join our group as well then with the status of an associated member.
For this, I will contact BBDC, BZML, ECDF, and PTB. If you have additional
suggestions, in which institutions colleagues might be interested,
please let me know.<br>
<br>
5.) Our webpage<br>
===============<br>
Our webpage <a href=https://mathplusmods.github.io>https://mathplusmods.github.io</a> is currently being
improved and extended. Our idea is to also provide various information
for students and researchers who are not yet that experienced in this
area. If you have any specific ideas of what should be included, please
let me know.<br>
<br>
6.) New GAMM Activity Group on "Computational and Mathematical Methods in Data Science"<br>
======================================================================================<br>

During the GAMM Annual Meeting in Vienna in February 2019, a new
GAMM Activity Group on "Computational and Mathematical Methods in
Data Science" was founded. This group is devoted to provide a platform
for researchers interested in or working on computational and
mathematical concepts within the field of Data Science or wanting
to enter it. for the initial first period of the activity group
Gitta Kutyniok and Martin Stoll were proposed as chairs.<br>
<br>
7.) SIAM Conference on Mathematics of Data Science 2020<br>
=======================================================<br>
Following the introduction of the new SIAM Journal on Mathematics of
Data Science, a new conference series is currently being introduced with
co-chairs Gitta Kutyniok, Ali Pinar, and Joel Tropp. The first SIAM
Conference on Mathematics of Data Science will take place in
Cincinnati, Ohio, USA on May 5â€“7, 2020. Please mark your calenders,
if you are interested to join.<br>
<br>
<br>
Finally, if you have any suggestions or comments, I would be very
happy if you could let me know.<br>
<br>
With best regards,<br>
Gitta Kutyniok<br>

              <summary><font size = 5>International Visitors</font></summary>
              <p>
                Dear colleagues,<br>
<br>
The topic of our activity group attracts many visitors and will attract even
more in the future. To strengthen interactions with visiting international
researchers, I would like to propose the following idea. Many of you might
have also experienced something similar when visiting a US university, i.e.,
being given a visiting/meeting schedule.<br>
<br>
The idea is to announce an incoming visitor to all members of our activity
group, so that (short, i.e., 30 minutes up to 1 hour) meetings (also for lunch
or dinner) can be scheduled for those who are interested. To my experience,
this is researchwise quite rewarding both for the colleague as well as also
for the visitor.<br>
<br>
In detail:<br>
<br>
1) If someone is expecting a visitor whom she/he thinks might be interesting
for colleagues, please write me a short note containing the name, affiliation,
visiting dates, main research focus, and who is the contact person (maybe a
secretary) for scheduling meetings.<br>
<br>
2) I will then announce this via the emailing list.<br>
<br>
3) Then interested members can write directly to the contact person to ask for
an appointment. It is then up to this contact person to assemble the schedule
and pass it to the visitor as well as the meeting partners.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope you like the idea. Please let me know if you have any comments.<br>
<br>
Kind regards,<br>
Gitta Kutyniok<br>

              <summary><font size = 5>Welcome Newsletter</font></summary>
              <p>Dear colleagues,<br>
<br>
                I would like to welcome you all very much to our MATH+
                Activity Group on Mathematics of Data Science. I am quite
                excited about the interest, and in fact our group has by now
                86 members (37 professors, 18 post-docs, 26 PhD students,
                and 5 master students). I think this is an amazing start!<br>
<br>                
                We are currently building up the structure of this group, and
                also the planning of our first events (in particular our first
                retreat) will soon start. Here are some initial information,
                which might be useful for you at this point:<br>
<br>                
                1) The emailing list is by now fully operational, and I will soon
                start posting some conferences etc. If you would like to post a
                workshop/conference/jobs in our area, please send me an
                email. A great thanks to Alex Goessmann, who organized this.<br>
<br>                
                2) A homepage is set up <a href=https://mathplusmods.github.io/ > https://mathplusmods.github.io/ </a>
                and will soon be filled. Please note that this is provisional
                until the "real" MATH+ webpage is complete. Here a great
                thanks to Hector Andrade Loarca for setting up our webpage.<br>
                <br>
                The next important stage is now to apply for funding for our
                events to the MATH+ board. If we are successful, we need to
                discuss ideas for our retreat, topics for our lecture series, etc.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, if you have any suggestions or comments, I would be
                very happy if you could let me know.<br>
                <br>
                With best regards,<br>
